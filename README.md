Duckling & Ball is a kid-led, teen-run organization that's trying to adult...I mean, create open-source, stylish operating systems, web experiences, and laptops that won't make you want to pull your hair out.

*Our Mission*
At Duckling & Ball, our mission is to empower young minds to shape the digital future, one hilarious meme at a time. We believe that technology should be accessible, beautiful, and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny.

*What We Do*
- *Open-Source OS*: We're creating a sleek, user-friendly operating system that's perfect for learning, creativity, and procrastination.
- *Web Experiences*: We're designing and developing web applications that are both stylish and functional...most of the time.
- *Laptops and PCs*: We're working on building affordable, high-quality laptops and PCs that won't make you want to throw them out the window (but no promises).

*Get Involved*
We're always looking for talented teens who share our passion for technology, design, and dad jokes. If you're interested in joining our team or contributing to our projects, please reach out to us on our Github Discussions. Don't worry, we won't make you do any boring meetings or paperwork... promise!
